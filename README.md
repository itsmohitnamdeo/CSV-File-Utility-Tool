- Filter Rows Based on Criteria: Allows filtering of rows based on user-defined conditions.

- Sort Rows by Column: Sorts rows in ascending or descending order based on a selected column.

- Aggregate Data (Sum, Average, etc.): Performs statistical calculations on a numeric column.

- Write to a New CSV File: Saves modified data into a new CSV file.

- Check for Palindromes: Identifies words that are palindromes and consist solely of the letters A, D, V, B, and N.

- Automated Tests: Includes unit tests to validate all functionalities.
